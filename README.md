# mvc
An MVC library from scratch

# examples

## todo
This is a simple example which uses the mvc library to create a todo list

## todo websockets
This uses the above example but intergrates websocket calls into app, so rather
than adding the model to the collection directly it sends the model to the server
then when the client recieves the model it adds it to the collection
